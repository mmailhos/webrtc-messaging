# WebRTC MessagingThis repo implements a simple messaging system accross web browsers using WebRTC to allow direct communications between clients.A third party, the signaling server, is used to let the clients exchange communication information. Then the signaling server is not used anymore during the conversation.The repo is hosting a simple webchat UI with its client.js and a signaling server made in Go.Update 12th July 2016: Now available on Opera, Firefox and Chrome.Update 9th January 2019: rewrote signaling server in a more idiomatic way.<center><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5645869/16680860/673b120a-44a6-11e6-8d65-1d3c8c384034.png" target="_blank"><img height="400" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5645869/16680860/673b120a-44a6-11e6-8d65-1d3c8c384034.png" alt="chat room"></a></center>## Install & Run```go run signaling```Open the index page in two different tabs.
